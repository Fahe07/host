Individuals can now obtain I-94 records from 1983 forward for most classes of admission (or parole), and indefinitely for certain classes, such as diplomats and those admitted under the Compacts of Free Association, provided the original I-94 is on file. <br> The Get Travel History section will provide the dates of your arrivals to and departures from the United States for the past ten years. <br> Some individuals (currently nonimmigrants who entered the U.S. under the Visa Waiver Program) can view their current compliance with their Form I-94, letting them know how many days remain until the admit until date. <br> United States Citizens (USCs) and Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs) are unable to utilize this website or the CBP One™ mobile application to look up information about themselves.",

A traveler can obtain their electronic arrival/departure record from the CBP I-94 website or the CBP One™ mobile application. A traveler lawfully admitted (or paroled) into the U.S. may print their lawful record of admission (Form I-94) from this CBP website or from the CBP One™ mobile application. If someone requests your admission information, this is the form you would provide. CBP may provide each traveler with an admission stamp that is annotated with date of admission, class of admission, and admit until date. The CBP admission stamp is listed as an alien registration document found in 8 CFR 264.1, Registration and Fingerprinting, which requires that certain nonimmigrant aliens be registered, fingerprinted, and photographed at the port of entry (POE) at the time the nonimmigrant aliens apply for admission.",

I-94 automation does not affect the Form I-9 process. However, the public should be prepared to see I-94 forms that will look differently than what they are used to seeing. Now, they may see both I-94 forms that have original stamps and writing on a card, in addition to I-94 forms that are printouts with no original writing or stamps on them. Travelers can print their own Form I-94 from this website using the 'Get Most Recent I-94' query or by using the same option on the CBP One™ mobile application. Both versions are acceptable for purposes involving Form I-9. For more information on the I-9 form and process, visit https://www.uscis.gov.",

An example of the new alphanumeric I-94 number is: 012345678A1.

If you are departing by air or sea, your departure is recorded electronically. There may be times when this information does not appear accurate. Also, some land border departures may not be recorded in CBP systems. Land border departures on the Southern Border are not always documented. A departure will be recorded if you depart via land and re-enter the United States prior to admit until date on your Form I-94 but may not be displayed on the website. If you are not a resident of Canada or Mexico and you receive an electronic I-94 and depart via land, but do not re-enter the United States prior to the admit until date on your Form I-94, you may want to travel with evidence of your departure into Canada or Mexico.
