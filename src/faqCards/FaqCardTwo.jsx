        To retrieve your most recent I-94 form, your travel history, or apply
        online for a new I-94, the following information is needed. Enter the
        information exactly as it appears on the travel document that you used
        to enter the United States. Generally, this document is your passport or
        border crossing card, however certain individuals who did not have
        either of these documents at the time of their arrival can use their
        Alien Registration Number to search for their record on the I-94 website
        or CBP One™ mobile application and retrieve or print their most recent
        electronic I-94 form.
